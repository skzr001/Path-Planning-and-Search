In View.py you can see the visualization of maze solving procedure.
Trough pressing map edit, you can change the dimension of our maze, change the probability of traps.
You could choose DFS, BFS, A* EUCLIDEAN, A* MANHATTAN to solve the maze.
You could use three property "fringe, tree size, and max path length" to generate hardest maze.

In visualization:
White Block: You can go through.
Black Block: You cannot go through.
Yellow Block: Nodes that have been visited during problem solving.
Green Block: Our final path to the destination.
